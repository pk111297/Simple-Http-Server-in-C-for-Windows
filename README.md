# Simple-Http-Server-in-C-for-Windows
This is a simple HTTP server code for Windows in C.
This is basically basic for understanding how the server works.

## Running
Now you have to run the server by the following command:
```bash
gcc server.c -o server.exe -l ws2_32
```

Now there will be some warnings but ignore them.

Now to run the code type
```bash
server.exe
 ```
